Hi, I am **Lorenzo Serina**.

I am a Computer Engineer and **PhD Researcher** at the University of Brescia, currently transitioning into full-time **AI Consultancy**. My professional focus is translating state-of-the-art research (Deep Learning, Automated Planning, NLP) into robust, scalable software solutions for companies.

Unlike traditional developers, I combine **academic rigor** with **production experience**. I have deployed Virtual Assistants for national infrastructures (Rai Way) and led R&D for innovative startups (SIMILAR).

### 🚀 How I can help your business:

* **R&D & Prototyping:** I build **MVPs** and production-ready systems using LLMs (RAG), Computer Vision, and Predictive Models.
* **Corporate Training:** I upskill technical teams with custom workshops on **Generative AI**, Python, and Software Architecture.
* **Strategic Consulting:** Feasibility studies and architectural design for complex AI integrations.
