### 🧠 The Context

In scenarios like robotics, security, and smart manufacturing, observing an agent's actions and predicting their goal is crucial. This is known as **Goal Recognition**.

### 🔬 My Research

My PhD work focuses on applying **Deep Learning** to Automated Planning tasks. I developed novel neural architectures (published at **AAMAS**) that can infer goals from partial observations with high accuracy, even in noisy environments.

- **Collaboration:** Research conducted at University of Brescia and **RWTH Aachen University** (Germany).
- **Application:** Predictive maintenance, Human-Robot Interaction, Security monitoring.
