### 🏢 The Challenge

Rai Way, the owner of the Italian national television transmission network, needed to optimize the management of internal and external support requests on their corporate portal.

### 💡 The Solution

I designed and developed a **Virtual Conversational Agent** (Chatbot) integrated directly into the company's infrastructure.

- **Tech Stack:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Python, Enterprise Integration.
- **Role:** Lead Developer (via BBS).
- **Key Feature:** The system handles diverse user intents automatically, reducing the load on human operators.

### 📈 Result

The system is currently **in production** and active on the Rai Way corporate portal, handling real-time customer support interactions.
